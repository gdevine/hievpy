        # HIEvPy
        HIEvPy is a python 3 wrapper around the API interface of the [HIEv](https://hiev.westernsydney.edu.au), a data capture 
        application used by the [Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie) at [Western 
        Sydney University](https://westernsydney.edu.au). 
        
        A short overview of the HIEvPy library, including installation instructions, is given below. Full 
        documentation, with examples, can be found on the project's [documentation pages](https://gdevine.github.io/hievpy).
        
        
        
        ### Pre-requisites
        To use HIEvPY you must have an active account (and subsequently a HIEv API token) on the 
        [**HIEv**](https://hiev.westernsydney.edu.au) application. To discuss registration please contact HIE's data manager, 
        [Gerry Devine](mailto:g.devine@westernsydney.edu.au)
        
        
        ### Installation
        **HIEvPy** can be installed via *pip*:
        
        ``` bash
        $ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ hievpy
        ```
        
        > Note: HIEvPy is currently hosted on Test PyPi. This will soon be moved to the official PyPi repository
        
        Once **HIEvPy** has been installed, you can import it into a python console or script using:
        
        ``` python
        import hievpy as hp
        ```
        (using the optional *as hp* as a shortcut)
        
        ### HIEvPy functions
        
        ##### Generic functions
        - **search**: Return a list of HIEv records matching a set of input search parameters
        - **search_download**: Perform a hievpy search and automatically downloads the matching files
        - **upload**: Upload a file to HIEv with associated metadata
        - **update_metadata**: Update metadata on a list of records returned by hievpy search
        
        ##### TOA5 functions
        - **toa5_summary**: Returns toa5 summary information (variable names, units and measurement types) for a given
            individual search-returned record.
        - **search_loaf_toa5df**: Performs a hievpy search and loads results into a pandas dataframe given the file records
        
        See the project's [documentation pages](https://gdevine.github.io/hievpy) for a full explanation of all **HIEvPy** functions
        
        ### Examples
        The __examples__ folder contains a number of example scripts outlining usage of the different **HIEvPy** functions. 
        
        To run any of the example scripts you need to create a file called *credentials.py* and populate it with your HIEv 
        API token, e.g:
          
            hiev_api_key = 'my_hiev_api_token'
